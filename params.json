{"name":"spi","tagline":"Standarize Personal Info so in future we can auto fill forms","body":"### Welcome to spi porject.\r\nThe idea in mind is to standarize the name of the input names of forms that request personal data. Through this standard, an script integrated, as Google Analytics does, in the form's web page can request a central server for the data needed giving standarized input names, so then this central server sends a push notification to the user's mobile app where he can refuse or accept the personal data request. The personal data is stored inside user's mobile app for security and it's send encrypted with a public key generated by the form script. Only the form script can decrypt the personal data retrieved. Once decrypted it will fill the form.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nIf a personal data it's not in user's mobile app, the app will ask the user to fill it and it will be saved for later request. Fill once in the mobile app, multiple use in web forms.\r\nThe mobile app would store the websites that requested you data so you would be in control where did you send your personal data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
